# TSC Security Policy
At **The Scratch Channel**, we're committed to privacy and security of information. We know that software isn't perfect, therefore it's important that you read and follow our policy carefully.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please go to the [Security Tab](https://github.com/The-Scratch-Channel/the-scratch-channel.github.io/security) and create an issue from there. This makes a private issue that only contributors can see, so it can be fixed before any potential harm can be done using the vulnerability. Your report should contain; a clear summary of the issue, steps to reproduce, enviroment details (OS, browser, device, etc.), the possible impact, and screenshots/videos to help us know what went wrong. Here's an example of a good report:

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't share any vulnerabilities with anyone other than contributors, to avoid them being abused, which can be illegal. Sharing them will result in legal action apon discovery
