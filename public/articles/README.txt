Submit an article

If you have read permissions... 

Firstly, write your article using the editor on our website. Make sure you input the date name and title. There is no need to have a heading that says your article name, because that is rendered already. Then, make a GitHub account if you don't already have one and go to our Issues page and create a new blank issue. Copy in the markdown you've downloaded (including the table part) and soon a developer will add it in.

If you have write permissions... 

Add it at the beginning of index.json, going from newest to oldest, because the article system does not sort by date but rather order in index.json.
