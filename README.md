## Deployment

There is no need to deploy this yourself if you do not want to contribute. If you just want to check out our site, you can visit <https://thescratchchannel.vercel.app/> and browse the live demo.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute but are not a contributor yet, follow these steps below.
However, if you find a vulnerability that requires immediate attention, go to the repositories [security tab](https://github.com/The-Scratch-Channel/the-scratch-channel.github.io/security) to report it. A vulnerability report should contain what file has the vulnerability, what priority it is, and extensive details.
- Create a fork of the repository

![Click on the fork button towards the top of the repository home page](https://u.cubeupload.com/SmartCat3/Screenshot2025041818.png)

- To clone your fork, run `git clone https://github.com/yourusernamehere/yourforknamehere.git`.

- Write your contributions
- Test your contributions in your clone by running `npm install`, then `npm run dev` and then going to localhost:5173 in your browser
> [!IMPORTANT]
>Ensure you have the latest version of node.js to use NPM. If your system is low end or cannot use localhost, you can do the same in a codespace, using PNPM.

- Commit and push them to your fork
- Create a pull request to show your changes, and if your PR has good work, we might pull it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to use `npm install` before running Vite, otherwise it will not load the required modules.
